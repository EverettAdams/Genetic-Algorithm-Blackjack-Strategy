# Genetic-Algorith-Blackjack-Strategy
This project was submitted as my term project for the Introduction to Computer Programming in Engineering and Science course at Dawson College for the winter 2020 term.

# Task
The objective of the project is to develop a genetic algorithm that optimizes a player betting strategy for a simplified version of Blackjack. The algorithmically generated strategy is compared against other betting strategies to gauge its performance.
